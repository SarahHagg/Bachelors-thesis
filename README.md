# Bachelors-thesis
This repository contains all the rawdata, pythoncodes and graphs from my internship at the CRI, Paris.
The 3 folders "Arabinose-gradient", "PrestwickScreen" and "Timecourse-arabinose" include all the data and analysis of my bachelor's thesis. The folder "Literature-compounds" holds additional data of an other experiment I did in order to find positive controls for the drug screen. This experiment is not mentioned in my thesis. 


The python scripts can be run if the whole folder including the rawdata was downloaded and if no filenames or filelocations were changed.
